## But WAIT!

There is another major flaw. The script is a rookie script & in not production ready.

Here is how you can make the script production ready

1- The code to setup and launch WebDriver (Firefox) should be improved to include Location   Firefox.exe    and a Firefox Profile must be created.
2- The amount of time the driver should wait when searching for a GUI element should be specified
3- The code to setup and launch Firefox should be created as a separate method.
4- All script initialization parameters like Location of Firefox , Base URL, User Name , Password etc should be stored in separate file say Util.java.  This helps in easy maintenance of script

Go ahead and code the script.
